# FPS_Arena_Online
This project I did with my schoolmate in 2021. It was my first game where I practiced NetCode in Unity. It is a prototype of FPS Arena deathmatch. The idea was to create small game in a short time(one week in total) with local and web connection. My part of this work was to create zone mechanics and player's spawning after connection. My teammate did lobby connection, which I also studied for own knowledge . It was my first touch in multiplayer. I practised working in short period with unfamiliar framework.
